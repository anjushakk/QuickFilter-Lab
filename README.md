# QuickFilter Lab üì∏

A full-stack web application that applies real-time filters to your photos using a Python/FastAPI backend and a vanilla JavaScript frontend.

*(You should add a screenshot of your live application here!)*

### About The Project

This project is a complete web tool built from scratch. It allows a user to upload any image, apply an artistic filter (like Grayscale, Sepia, or Invert), and get the processed image back instantly.

It demonstrates a modern full-stack workflow by separating a powerful **Python backend** (which does all the heavy lifting) from a dynamic, responsive **JavaScript frontend** (which the user sees and interacts with).

### ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Filtering:** Apply Grayscale, Sepia, and Invert filters.

* **Dynamic UI:** A clean, dark-mode interface built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

* **Image Upload:** Modern file selector for any image type.

* **Loading State:** A CSS spinner appears while the backend is processing the image.

* **Download Button:** Instantly download your newly filtered image.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn

* **Image Processing:** Pillow, NumPy

* **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
